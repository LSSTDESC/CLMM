# CLMM [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/clmm/badge/?version=master)](https://clmm.readthedocs.io/en/master/?badge=master) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LSSTDESC/CLMM.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LSSTDESC/CLMM)

A new and improved cluster mass modeling code descended from [clmassmod](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/clmassmod)

## Installation Instructions

## Overview

CLMM (Cluster Lensing Mass Modelling) provides a tool to estimate cluster masses based on weak lensing data. It also includes a routine to make mock catalogs based on Cluster Toolkit. By running CLMM, the whole process is able to be conducted from making source galaxies for a given mass and to estimate mass from the measured weak lensing signal.    

* Mock data generation 

* Cluster object parameters

* Weak lensing signal measurement
