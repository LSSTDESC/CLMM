Citing CLMM
*************

This code, while public on GitHub, has not yet been released by
DESC and is still under active development.  Our release of v1.0 will
be accompanied by a journal paper describing the development and
validation of `CLMM`.

If you make use of the ideas or software here, please cite this
repository ``https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CLMM``. You are welcome to
re-use the code, which is open source and available under terms
consistent with our `LICENSE
<https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CLMM/blob/master/LICENSE>`_ (`BSD 3-Clause
<https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`_).

External contributors and DESC members wishing to use CLMM for non-DESC projects
should consult with the CL working group conveners, ideally before the work has
started, but definitely before any publication or posting of the work to the arXiv.
